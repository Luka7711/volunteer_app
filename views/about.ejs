<h1>What is "Better World"?</h1>

<p> Do you ever find yourself feeling hopeless in the face of so many devastating events happening in the world?</p> 
<p>Do you believe in love, kindness, compassion, empathy and humility?</p>
<p>Do you really want to help make this world a better place but don't really know where to start and don't always have the time or the ability to travel to the places that would benefit from your help?</p>
<p>Are we asking you too many questions? :)</p>
<p>Have no fear! Start small! Because you have to start somewhere, and we are here to help you help :) Better World is a website that allows you to create your own events to help others. Don't wait for non-profit organizations to host an event - be the one taking action, create your own volunteering opportunity! </p>
<p>ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’•Reveal the beauty of the human soul - one small or big step at a time ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’•</p>
